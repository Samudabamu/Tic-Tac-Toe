# What this project is about

Project 0 is a simple tic-tac-toe game where users are able to play a game against one another using traditional game rules. The code is designed to scale up to larger boards (4x4, 5x5 etc)

Designed using Javascript and JQuery, on each players click a .png is appended to the "clicked" box. At the same time an abstract layer is created so the code can establish where the user has clicked and if a "win event" has been achieved.
